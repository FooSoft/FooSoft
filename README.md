# Leaving GitHub

I'm migrating my open source work away from GitHub. Individual project pages will soon be updated to reflect this
change. Once the migration is complete, all repositories will be archived and will receive no further updates.

My projects now live at [git.foosoft.net/alex](https://git.foosoft.net/alex).
